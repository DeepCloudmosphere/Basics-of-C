This line of code prints the statement between quotation marks on your output screen. \n tells program to start a new line in output screen.
Each command line in C ends with ";" character. Control statements are exceptions.

## }
- closes main() function.
 
## Compiling and Running on Unix/Linux
- To compile program under Unix operating system use the command: - > $ cc test.c
- and under linux type -> $ gcc test.c
- The resulting executable file is a.out file. To run this executable you must type:-> $ ./a.out
